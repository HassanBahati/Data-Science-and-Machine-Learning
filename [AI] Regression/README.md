Linear Regression - continuous data eg temperature, age - data should be linearly distributed

### Libraries
`numpy` - np. Multidimesional data arrays

`pandas` - pd. Generates data frames used in data science

`matplotlib` - mat. creates plots and graphs in 2D

`scikit-learn` - sklearn. Has ML algorithms for SL and USL



- import data
- clean
- subset data using variables eg X for platform field in data
- train model using decision trees in sklearn

just to know where to split based on the question 


- ranges are categorical
- 


categorical data - classification approach of supervised learning
continuious data eg age, temp - regression approach of unsupervised learning
